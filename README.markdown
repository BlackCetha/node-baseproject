# NodeJS base project

This project contains all the neccessary bootstrapping and structure to write a high-quality nodejs app.

The only thing missing is automated tests, but there are too many options to consider to put a specific library into this general-purpose project.

This project has extended support for Visual Studio Code and its debugging features. You will be able to set breakpoints and other debug markers in the typescript source and they will still be hit while executing compiled javascript.

There is also a travis-ci configuration file which can be used to enforce style or run automated tests later. Travis CI is free for open source projects and with the github student program.
